## Introduction

When I first built [sysinformer](https://github.com/timmyb824/sysinformer), my goal was simple: make it easier to get system information and status without memorizing a bunch of cryptic commands or sifting through verbose outputs. The [Python version](https://github.com/timmyb824/python-sysinformer) worked well enough for my needs, but it had one big limitation—portability. Like many Python tools, it required a Python environment, which meant I only ever used it on my main machines where I had everything set up. That wasn't what I wanted for sysinformer.

Inspired by the experience of porting [pingpulse](https://github.com/timmyb824/pingpulse) to Go, I decided to give sysinformer the same treatment. The result? A tool that's not only faster, but also truly portable. Now, you can install sysinformer on almost any host with a single command:

```sh
sudo sh -c 'curl -fSsL https://github.com/timmyb824/sysinformer/releases/download/v1.0.7/sysinformer-linux-amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/sysinformer && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sysinformer'
```

No Python, no dependencies—just a single binary that works out of the box.

### Why Go?

Go makes it easy to build static binaries that run anywhere. That means sysinformer is now a zero-dependency tool: just download, make it executable, and you’re set. No more worrying about Python versions, pip installs, or missing packages.

### What Does sysinformer Do?

sysinformer is designed to save you from having to remember commands like `ip a` or `docker ps --format ...` just to get a clean view of your network interfaces, containers, disks, or other system info. Instead of parsing through raw command output or writing your own scripts, sysinformer presents the information you need in a clear, readable format.

### What’s New?

- **Portability**: Install and run sysinformer on any modern Mac or Linux host with a single command.
- **Speed**: The Go version is noticeably faster than the original Python implementation.
- **Simplicity**: No dependencies or setup—just a single binary.

### Try It Out

Ready to give it a spin? Just run:

```sh
sudo sh -c 'curl -fSsL https://github.com/timmyb824/sysinformer/releases/download/v1.0.7/sysinformer-linux-amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/sysinformer && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sysinformer'
```

Then type `sysinformer --help` to see what it can do.

**Note**: the latest version is available at [https://github.com/timmyb824/sysinformer/releases/latest](https://github.com/timmyb824/sysinformer/releases/latest).
